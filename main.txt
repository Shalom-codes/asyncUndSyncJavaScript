this is just a text of nothing actually. perharps just my random thoughts. hey! 
i think i should go back to writting
ok really, at what point did i become so relaxed and stop seekinf knowledge?
truth is i have not read a book in two years.
growth is progressive but i should go back to who i used to be.
reading, writting and knowing a bit of everything.
what is my future in software engineering? start by being serious. just saying lol
